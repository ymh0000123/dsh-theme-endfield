    /* --- Durable write gate -----------------------------------------------
       A scope snapshot from @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings carries three
       flags that must ALL hold before a scope.set can durably land:
         mode    === 'host'   loopback page syncing the Host document.
                              'memory' (non-loopback) never persists.
         status  === 'ready'  the Host's describe view actually SERVES this
                              namespace and a decoded value stands. It stays
                              'loading' before the first accepted section and
                              becomes 'unavailable' when the namespace is NOT in
                              the host's served list (the host half has not run
                              its ctx.settings.register(...) yet, or the mirror
                              last fetched before it appeared). A scope.set into
                              a 'loading'/'unavailable' host scope reaches no
                              durable store.
         writable=== true     the Host document accepts writes.
       Gating on snap.writable ALONE is the old bug: a host-mode describe view
       answers writable=true even while this namespace is still unserved, so the
       old code fired scope.set into a namespace the host had not registered,
       cleared the dirty mark and logged the misleading
       `commit ... status= unavailable` warn — the preference kept working for
       the page session but vanished on the next reload. We issue a real wire
       write only once the namespace is genuinely served, and keep the edit
       dirty so a later ready transition (re)plays it. */

       honour, i.e. the edits that need re-committing onto the declared field.

       WHEN IS THE DECLARED FIELD THE USER'S OWN VALUE? This is the whole
       question, because a fetched section ALWAYS carries every declared field:
       the schema merges its defaults into the stored section, so
       `hasOwnProperty` cannot tell a user-set value from an implied default.
       And in practice only ONE signal can: a value that differs from the shipped
       default. A declared field sitting at its default is indistinguishable from
       an untouched one — the section is the merged view, so nothing survives in
       it to say whether the document stored that default or the schema inserted
       it. Therefore:

         declared absent or === default  -> nothing recorded a choice for this
                                            field, so the stray legacy key is the
                                            only trace of one: honour it.
         declared set to anything else    -> a correctly-writing build stored it,
                                            so it wins and the stray key is
                                            ignored. (Never let the pre-migration
                                            spelling overwrite a real edit.)

       That makes the migration idempotent in the good direction: after the value
