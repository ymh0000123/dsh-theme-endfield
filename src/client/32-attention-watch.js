    /* ---------- 需要你回应 watcher ----------
       A coarse poll rather than a MutationObserver. The reason is the failure mode
       rather than the cost: an observer watching a container that the app later
       replaces (or an anchor that renders before `document.body` exists) stops
       delivering and cannot tell anyone, while a poll that asks "is a confirmation
       box on screen?" keeps working through any re-render, and its only symptom is
       up to `AUDIO_ATTENTION_POLL_MS` of latency — imperceptible for a chime.

       The edge is "a box is on screen after a moment where none was". A box that
       stays open does not re-report, so a forgotten dialog cannot beep forever; and
       a re-render that briefly drops the node and puts it back would re-report, so
       the poll is deliberately slower than a React remount. Whatever still slips
       through lands on the host's per-slot debounce, which is the backstop for
       every path. */
    /* Detection is edge-triggered on a MutationObserver, with a slow poll as the
       backstop. The first version polled alone at 400ms, which stacked its
       worst-case latency on top of the ~200-400ms it takes the host to cold-start
       the player process — the user measured the total as "a bit delayed". The
       observer cuts the first term to roughly one animation frame; the poll stays
       because an observer bound to a container the app later replaces would stop
       delivering silently, and a poll cannot. Its period is deliberately longer
       than a React remount, so a re-render that briefly drops and re-adds the node
       cannot register as two separate boxes. */

       mutations into a single look. */
