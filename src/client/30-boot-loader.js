    /* ---------- boot loading screen (settings-toggleable, default OFF) ----------
       Recreates the Endfield launcher boot screen: a full-viewport black plate with
       an 8px signal-yellow progress rail down the left edge, a meter group (tick +
       percentage + status line) that rides the fill end, and the centred ENDFIELD
       wordmark. It plays once per page load, then fades out and removes itself.

       Default OFF as requested: a loading plate that covers the app is opt-in, and
       an off switch must cost nothing, so nothing is built or timed until enabled.

       Geometry is not guessed — it is measured off the reference frame (1340x731):
         rail width 8px, fill 57.5% of viewport height at the captured moment,
         meter left edge x=24, tick 4x15px, digits cap-height 28px (~39px Arial),
         status line 15px below the digits in #666.
       Those ratios are reproduced here as em/percentage values so they hold at any
       viewport size. */
